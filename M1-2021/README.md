# Setup

Installed manually:

- browsers
- iterm2
- vscode
- homebrew
- ohmyzsh (see .zshrc for more info, plugins, theme, etc)
- docker desktop

Installed via Homebrew:

- fzf
- git
- node
- starship
- yarn
- qlmarkdown (cask, see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/297247)

Recommended install order:

1. browsers, because you gotta start somewhere
2. iterm2 w/ imported json profile, you'll be in the cli before you know it and terminal is meh
3. vscode, you definitely don't wanna use textedit
4. homebrew w/ formulae + casks, you'll at least need git
5. ohmyzsh w/ .zshrc setup, finally the good stuff
6. docker desktop, whatever
